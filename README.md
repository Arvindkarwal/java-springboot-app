## Overview

Welcome to my **DevOps Project** repository! This project is designed to demonstrate my proficiency in various **DevOps tools** and **technologies** that I have learned and applied throughout my journey. The primary goal of this project is to deploy a **Contact Manager App** built with **Java Spring Boot** using modern DevOps practices and tools.

By showcasing this project, I aim to exhibit my hands-on experience with continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), containerization, cloud infrastructure, and GitOps principles, all of which are critical for the DevOps role.

## Purpose

The main objective of this project is to set up a fully automated **CI/CD pipeline** for a Java Spring Boot-based application using popular tools in the DevOps ecosystem. This will include deploying the app in a **Kubernetes (EKS)** cluster on **AWS** and utilizing **Helm** for Kubernetes resource management, **ArgoCD** for GitOps, and **Docker** for containerization. I also aim to showcase best practices in cloud infrastructure, security, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

## Technologies and Tools Used

This project involves using a wide range of **DevOps tools and technologies**, which include:

- **Version Control**: Git
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, ArgoCD (GitOps), SonarQube, JUnit
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes (AWS EKS), Helm
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS (EC2, VPC, Route 53)
- **Cloud Networking**: VPC, EC2 components, Traffic Routing
- **CI Tools**: Jenkins for Continuous Integration and Delivery
- **Monitoring and Security**: SonarQube for code quality, AWS CloudWatch for monitoring
- **DNS Configuration**: Route53 for DNS configuration (www.flowci.in/ and www.flowci.in/about)
- **Scripting & Troubleshooting**: Linux commands, troubleshooting skills
